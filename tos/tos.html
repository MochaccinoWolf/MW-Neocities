            Once a commission is completed, there may be two files. The first file may be of lower resolution and marked; this is for sharing among friends and the internet. The second file will be identical sans the artist's 'watermark'. This file is for the client only.

If the client requests an adjustment to a part of the work that is already completed, the artist may not be able to complete the adjustment. Such modifications should be noted at the appropriate time, when an image is given to the client for approval.
